                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname
                    long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and
                    fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

                Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted.
                The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites
                and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the
                    United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower,
                    and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to
                    appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the
                    mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this
                    run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts
                    outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great
                    whitewater opportunities.

                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X (
                    1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the
                    regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
